Game title: 2048

Merge the tiles that have the same numbers together until you reach the number 2048. Any movement made will spawn a block, numbered 2 or 4 by random and in a random place. All the movements will move the blocks to the edge / max of the grid in that chosen direction. If two blocks have the same number and collide, then they will merge. If two blocks have different numbers and collide, then they will collide and stop. The game will be over if there are no empty tiles left and no possible movements are possible. 

Instructions:

Use arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to move tiles.

Tiles with the same number merge into one.
