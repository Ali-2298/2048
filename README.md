Game title: 2048

Merge the tiles that have the same numbers together until you reach the number 2048. Any movement made will spawn a block, numbered 2 or 4 by random and in a random place. 

Pseudocode: 

1. Declare variables and create a 4x4 grid for the blocks to go in. Create a variable for score. 

2. Create divs for the score, individual tiles, and the game over screen.

3. initialize the game by placing random 2 or 4 tiles in empty spots on the grid. 

4. Event listeners for up, down, left, and 
right for block movement.

5. If the grid changes (moves), add a random 2 or 4 in an empty spot. 
 
6. Update the score after each merge.

7. Check for game over. If no empty cells are left and no merges are possible.
